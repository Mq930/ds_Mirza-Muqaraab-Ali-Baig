# Summary
>The highest trading volumes were consistently recorded during periods of Fear. This suggests that traders are most active not during stable markets, but during times of uncertainty and downturns, likely capitalizing on volatility.

>The most successful trader did the opposite of what you might expect. When the market was fearful, they bet that prices would go down (shorting). When the market was greedy, they bought in, expecting prices to go up (going long).

>When the market was either very fearful or very greedy, traders saw the biggest wins and the biggest losses. When the market felt "Neutral," the results were much more stable and less extreme.

>The overall feeling of the market affected which coins made money. For example, the coin ZRO made its biggest profits when the market was in a "Greed" phase.
